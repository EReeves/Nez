	///     will perform an in-Scene transition as opposed to loading a new Scene mid transition.
	///     The general gist of a transition is the following:
	///     - onBeginTransition will be called allowing you to yield for multipart transitions
	///     - for two part transitions with Effects you can yield on a call to tickEffectProgressProperty for part one to
	///     obscure the screen
	///     - next, yield a call to loadNextScene to load up the new Scene
	///     - finally, yield again on tickEffectProgressProperty to un-obscure the screen and show the new Scene
